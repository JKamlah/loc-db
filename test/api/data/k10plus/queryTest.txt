Offering home-based rapid testing of syphilis to couples during pregnancy can support prevention efforts to reduce transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes. METHODSWe assessed men’s uptake of paired (separate tests, single blood draw) point-of-care syphilis and HIV tests within a randomized controlled trial of pregnant women who received clinic or home partner HIV testing. We evaluated acceptance of paired HIV-syphilis testing during pregnancy or at 6 months postpartum, and evaluated whether addition of syphilis testing affected the uptake of HIV testing among men. RESULTSOf 601 women, we were unable to meet 101 male partners, and 180 tested before syphilis tests were available. Paired syphilis and HIV testing was offered at home to 80 men during pregnancy and to 230 men postpartum. For syphilis, 93% of men agreed to test during pregnancy and 98% agreed postpartum. For paired syphilis and HIV testing, 91% of men tested for both during pregnancy and 96% tested postpartum. Before syphilis test introduction, 96% of men accepted HIV testing, compared with 95% of men who accepted HIV testing when paired testing was offered. CONCLUSIONSUptake of syphilis and HIV testing was high among male partners offered couple testing at home. Introducing syphilis testing did not adversely affect HIV testing among men. Point-of-care diagnostics outside facilities can increase testing of male partners who rarely accompany women to antenatal clinics.

This is a 5-year retrospective descriptive report on the incidence of events associated with maximal physical testing from 536 patients, totalizing 5,910 tests. Tests were classified as cardiopulmonary, muscle strength, and physical functioning tests. Any adverse events during the tests and limiting factors incurring in tests cancellation were reported. Eighteen out of 641 cardiopulmonary exercise tests had an adverse occurrence, with cardiac disturbance (1.4 % of total tests) being the most prevalent. Moreover, 14 out of 641 tests were not feasible. Out of 3,478 tests comprising leg press, bench press, knee extension, and handgrip tests, 15 tests had an adverse event. The most common occurrence was joint pain (0.4 % of total tests), which was also the most frequent factor precluding testing (0.5 % of total tests). Forty-five out of 3,478 (1.3 %) of the tests were not feasible. There was a very low incidence of events (0.2 %) during the physical functioning tests. Joint pain was the only adverse event during the tests, whereas physical limitations were the most important barriers for the execution of the tests (1.1 % of total tests). The incidence of limiting events in this test was 1.6 % (n = 29). This report brings new data on the safety and feasibility of maximal physical testing in rheumatic patients. The physical tests described in this study may be applied for testing rheumatic patients both in research and clinical setting.

        "abstract":["The purpose of the study was to report on the safety and feasibility of the application of maximal physical tests in a heterogeneous cohort of rheumatic patients. This is a 5-year retrospective descriptive report on the incidence of events associated with maximal physical testing from 536 patients, totalizing 5,910 tests. Tests were classified as cardiopulmonary, muscle strength, and physical functioning tests. Any adverse events during the tests and limiting factors incurring in tests cancellation were reported. Eighteen out of 641 cardiopulmonary exercise tests had an adverse occurrence, with cardiac disturbance (1.4 % of total tests) being the most prevalent. Moreover, 14 out of 641 tests were not feasible. Out of 3,478 tests comprising leg press, bench press, knee extension, and handgrip tests, 15 tests had an adverse event. The most common occurrence was joint pain (0.4 % of total tests), which was also the most frequent factor precluding testing (0.5 % of total tests). Forty-five out of 3,478 (1.3 %) of the tests were not feasible. There was a very low incidence of events (0.2 %) during the physical functioning tests. Joint pain was the only adverse event during the tests, whereas physical limitations were the most important barriers for the execution of the tests (1.1 % of total tests). The incidence of limiting events in this test was 1.6 % (n = 29). This report brings new data on the safety and feasibility of maximal physical testing in rheumatic patients. The physical tests described in this study may be applied for testing rheumatic patients both in research and clinical setting.",

For permission to use (where not already granted under a licence) please go to http://www.bmj.com/company/products-services/rights-and-licensing HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men (MSM) in several high-income countries, including Australia, have increased substantially over recent years. Australia, in line with global prevention strategies, has emphasised a 'test and treat' HIV prevention strategy which relies on timely detection of HIV through frequent testing by those at risk. We examined trends in repeat testing among MSM defined as 'high-risk' according to Australian testing guidelines. HIV test records from MSM attending high caseload clinics in Melbourne 2007-2013 and classified as high-risk were analysed. Binary outcomes of 'test within 3 months' and 'test within 6 months' were assigned to tests within individuals' panel of records. Negative binomial regressions assessed trends in overall HIV testing and returning within 3 and 6 months. Annualised proportions of return tests (2007-2012) were compared using two-sample z tests. Across 18 538 tests among 7117 high-risk MSM attending primary care clinics in Melbourne (2007-2013), the number of annual HIV tests increased (p<0.01). Between 2007 and 2012 annualised proportions of tests with a subsequent test within 3 and 6 months also increased (p<0.01); however, by 2012 only 36.4% and 15.1% of tests were followed by another test inside 6 and 3 months, respectively. Repeat testing among high-risk MSM in Australia remains unacceptably low, with recent modest increases in testing unlikely to deliver meaningful prevention impact. Removing known barriers to HIV testing is needed to maximise the potential benefit of test and treat-based HIV prevention.

Australia, in line with global prevention strategies, has emphasised a 'test and treat' HIV prevention strategy which relies on timely detection of HIV through frequent testing by those at risk. We examined trends in repeat testing among MSM defined as 'high-risk' according to Australian testing guidelines. HIV test records from MSM attending high caseload clinics in Melbourne 2007-2013 and classified as high-risk were analysed. Binary outcomes of 'test within 3 months' and 'test within 6 months' were assigned to tests within individuals' panel of records. Negative binomial regressions assessed trends in overall HIV testing and returning within 3 and 6 months. Annualised proportions of return tests (2007-2012) were compared using two-sample z tests. Across 18 538 tests among 7117 high-risk MSM attending primary care clinics in Melbourne (2007-2013), the number of annual HIV tests increased (p<0.01). Between 2007 and 2012 annualised proportions of tests with a subsequent test within 3 and 6 months also increased (p<0.01); however, by 2012 only 36.4% and 15.1% of tests were followed by another test inside 6 and 3 months, respectively. Repeat testing among high-risk MSM in Australia remains unacceptably low, with recent modest increases in testing unlikely to deliver meaningful prevention impact.

Experimental studies in biomedical research frequently pose analytical problems related to small sample size. In such studies, there are conflicting findings regarding the choice of parametric and nonparametric analysis, especially with non‐normal data. In such instances, some methodologists questioned the validity of parametric tests and suggested nonparametric tests. In contrast, other methodologists found nonparametric tests to be too conservative and less powerful and thus preferred using parametric tests. Some researchers have recommended using a bootstrap test; however, this method also has small sample size limitation. We used a pooled method in nonparametric bootstrap test that may overcome the problem related with small samples in hypothesis testing. The present study compared nonparametric bootstrap test with pooled resampling method corresponding to parametric, nonparametric, and permutation tests through extensive simulations under various conditions and using real data examples. The nonparametric pooled bootstrap t ‐test provided equal or greater power for comparing two means as compared with unpaired t ‐test, Welch t ‐test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and permutation test while maintaining type I error probability for any conditions except for Cauchy and extreme variable lognormal distributions. In such cases, we suggest using an exact Wilcoxon rank sum test. Nonparametric bootstrap paired t ‐test also provided better performance than other alternatives. Nonparametric bootstrap test provided benefit over exact Kruskal–Wallis test. We suggest using nonparametric bootstrap test with pooled resampling method for comparing paired or unpaired means and for validating the one way analysis of variance test results for non‐normal data in small sample size studies.

In such studies, there are conflicting findings regarding the choice of parametric and nonparametric analysis, especially with non‐normal data. In such instances, some methodologists questioned the validity of parametric tests and suggested nonparametric tests. In contrast, other methodologists found nonparametric tests to be too conservative and less powerful and thus preferred using parametric tests. Some researchers have recommended using a bootstrap test; however, this method also has small sample size limitation. We used a pooled method in nonparametric bootstrap test that may overcome the problem related with small samples in hypothesis testing. The present study compared nonparametric bootstrap test with pooled resampling method corresponding to parametric, nonparametric, and permutation tests through extensive simulations under various conditions and using real data examples. The nonparametric pooled bootstrap t ‐test provided equal or greater power for comparing two means as compared with unpaired t ‐test, Welch t ‐test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and permutation test while maintaining type I error probability for any conditions except for Cauchy and extreme variable lognormal distributions. In such cases, we suggest using an exact Wilcoxon rank sum test. Nonparametric bootstrap paired t ‐test also provided better performance than other alternatives.

The Tukey test belongs to the family of weighted-ranking test from Quade (1979).The modified Friedman test, the Friedman test and the Tukey test are compared under various conditions and the results indicate that the proposed test is generally more powerful than the Friedman test and the Tukey test when the number of groups is small.

This has led to high volumes of test data and long test times. Therefore, reducing test cost by minimizing the overall test time is one of the main goals of SoC testing. To efficiently manage test resources and power dissipation, tests for the SoC cores are arranged into test schedules. Traditional SoC test methods assume a constant test frequency and supply voltage (V D D ) for the entire test schedule. However, test power and test time can be regulated by varying V D D and test clock frequency to optimize SoC test schedules for a given power budget. The research presented in this paper focuses on power-aware optimization of SoC test schedules to minimize test time by scaling the supply voltage and test clock rate. This scaling can be on a per session basis (in case of session-based test schedules) or dynamically (in case of sessionless test schedules). Exact and heuristic algorithms for solving the optimization problem are discussed. These algorithms are implemented and applied to several SoC benchmarks. Results show a significant reduction in SoC test time over the conventional test schedules where V D D and clock are fixed at given nominal values.

This has led to high volumes of test data and long test times. Therefore, reducing test cost by minimizing the overall test time is one of the main goals of SoC testing. To efficiently manage test resources and power dissipation, tests for the SoC cores are arranged into test schedules. Traditional SoC test methods assume a constant test frequency and supply voltage (V D D ) for the entire test schedule. However, test power and test time can be regulated by varying V D D and test clock frequency to optimize SoC test schedules for a given power budget. The research presented in this paper focuses on power-aware optimization of SoC test schedules to minimize test time by scaling the supply voltage and test clock rate. This scaling can be on a per session basis (in case of session-based test schedules) or dynamically (in case of sessionless test schedules). Exact and heuristic algorithms for solving the optimization problem are discussed. These algorithms are implemented and applied to several SoC benchmarks. Results show a significant reduction in SoC test time over the conventional test schedules where V D D and clock are fixed at given nominal values.#30;1 #31;aSheshadri, Vijay#30;1 #31;aAgrawal, Vishwani D#30;1 #31;aAgrawal, Prathima#30;08#31;iin#31;tJournal of electronic testing : JETTA ; theory and applications#31;dBoston, Mass.

This study reports current test use and discusses whether these traditions still influence attitudes toward test use and choice of tests. Method: The study is based on survey data from 702 Nordic neuropsychologists. Results: The average participant used 9 tests in a standard assessment, and 25 tests overall in their practice. Test use was moderated by nationality, competence level, practice profile, and by attitude toward test selection. Participants who chose their tests flexibly used fewer tests than those adhering to the flexible battery approach, but had fewer tests from which to choose. Testing patients with psychiatric disorders was associated with using more tests. IQ, memory, attention, and executive function were the domains with the largest utilization rate, while tests of motor, visual/spatial, and language were used by few. There is a lack of academic achievement tests. Screening tests played a minor role in specialized assessments, and symptom validity tests were seldom applied on a standard basis. Most tests were of Anglo-American origin. Conclusions: New test methods are implemented rapidly in the Nordic countries, but test selection is also characterized by the dominating position of established and much researched tests. The Halstead-Reitan and Luria traditions are currently weak, but national differences in size of test batteries seem to be influenced by these longstanding traditions.

In Japan, understanding the environmental persistence of chemicals is very important for risk assessment, and ready biodegradability tests are mainly conducted according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development test guideline 301C. However, the highest test concentration specified in test guideline 301C, 100 mg/L, may cause microbial toxicity and incomplete biodegradation. The authors performed test guideline 301C tests at test concentrations of 30 mg/L for 13 substances that were readily biodegradable in ready biodegradability tests but not in test guideline 301C tests. Of the 5 substances with potential to cause microbial toxicity at 100 mg/L, the percentage of biodegradation of sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate, 4-chloro-3-cresol (CC), thymol (THY), and p-tert-butyl-α-methylbenzenepropionaldehyde measured by biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) increased in the test guideline 301C test at 30 mg/L, suggesting a reduction in toxicity effects. Furthermore, CC and THY met the criteria for ready biodegradability, which are more than 60% of biodegradation by BOD and a 10-d window. Of the 8 substances with a low potential for causing microbial toxicity at 100 mg/L, the percentage of biodegradation of only 2-(diethylamino)ethanol increased in the test guideline 301C test at 30 mg/L. Employing a lower test concentration in the standard test guideline 301C test will contribute to improvement of consistency between results of a test guideline 301C test and other ready biodegradability tests.

Of the 8 substances with a low potential for causing microbial toxicity at 100 mg/L, the percentage of biodegradation of only 2-(diethylamino)ethanol increased in the test guideline 301C test at 30 mg/L. Employing a lower test concentration in the standard test guideline 301C test will contribute to improvement of consistency between results of a test guideline 301C test and other ready biodegradability tests.
